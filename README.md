This repo contains the following 2 projects:

- Project Seeds Dataset: It is an analysis of the "Seeds" dataset using partitional clustering techniques. The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning repository, consists of measurements of geometric properties of wheat kernels from three different varieties: Kama, Rosa, and Canadian.

- Project Wine Dataset: This project aims to explore and analyze the Wine dataset using clustering techniques. The dataset contains various attributes related to wine, and we will perform clustering to identify meaningful groups within the data. The primary clustering algorithms used in this project are Hierarchical Clustering, K-means, and K-medoids.
